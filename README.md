# Cozy CV Site

A single-file, warm and minimalist personal website/CV.

## Quick edit
Open `index.html` and replace placeholders: name, role, links, experience, projects, skills, education.

## Publish on GitHub Pages (free)
1. Create a repo called `your-username.github.io`.
2. Upload `index.html` to the root of the repo and commit.
3. Visit `https://your-username.github.io` (usually live within a minute).
4. (Optional) Add a custom domain in repo **Settings → Pages**.

## Alternative: Netlify Drop (free, very fast)
1. Go to Netlify Drop and drag the `index.html` file.
2. You’ll get a free site URL like `something.netlify.app`.

## Tip
Keep the page one screen wide, focus on clarity and kindness. You can always grow it later.
